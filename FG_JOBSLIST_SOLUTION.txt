if a fg command was entered by a user, our solution will be to take
the job and send SIGCONT to the corresponding PID.

if CTRL+Z was entered by the user then we will check if the PID is in the jobs-list
if it is we will just reset the timer of this job.
if it's not in the jobs-list we will add it as a new job.

the job will be removed from the jobs list in the smash.cpp
in the command:
"        smash.jobsList.removeFinishedJobs(); "
when it will be finished or when it will get CTRL+C.
